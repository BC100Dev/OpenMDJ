# OpenMDJ
OpenMDJ is a project I decided to tackle, especially when I eventually had to use StarUML in school. However, since it is paywalled and that paid program has a proprietary format, I eventually asked ChatGPT about some specifics and figured out that their "proprietary" format isn't that proprietary at all. Beneath their MDJ files is just a plain and simple JSON format that can be parsed. Considering this finding, I decided to battle up that format and get it to work. On both Linux and Windows, using Qt6 as the GUI base. MacOS users can use `wine` for convenience (yes, I'm wine friendly, get it?)

Longer description coming soon. Don't worry, I'll cook it up.
